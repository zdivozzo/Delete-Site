# DeleteSite.js
A small javascript file that can be included on any webpage to slowly delete the page, DOM node by DOM node.

Stick it on the console of any site and watch it slowly disappear.  Better yet, slip it into a website undetected.

By default it deletes a node every second, but this can be adjusted.

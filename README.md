# DeleteSite.js
A small javascript file that can be included on any webpage to slowly delete the page, DOM node by DOM node.

Stick it on the console of any site and watch it slowly disappear before your very eyes.  Better yet, slip it into a website undetected to make users think they're losing their minds.

By default it deletes a node every second, but this can easily be adjusted.

Demo site coming soon
